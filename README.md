  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  The skin is arguably one of the most dening factors of our appearance. Poor skin
conditions could make us less condent and aect our mental health. It could also be an
indicator of our physical health. When we experience skin problems, we often feel
embarrassed to meet others or seek professional help. Many would prefer to check for
diseases online to self-diagnose and identify treatments to cure themselves or prevent
transmission. When we conduct online health consultations, we are often confused about
describing the symptoms, especially when we can't show them directly or in person. Based
on our research on existing health consultation applications, there is still no image
recognition feature that allows us to identify skin conditions through images. Therefore, our
team plans to create an application that can identify skin conditions through images, repo
potential causes, and give recommendations for treatment to help others diagnose their
condition more accurately. Our application is not intended to serve as a substitute for
professional consultations, which is why our application will recommend users to consult a
professional should their skin conditions be severe enough or are hard to identify.

<h2>Features</h2>

- Skin Detection: Users can detect their skin using camera or pictures from gallery.
- Skin Conditions: Present the result based on picture input. The result including Condition, Confidence, Cause, Description, Severity, and Treatment.
- Recommendation: Recommend users to consult with professional when the skin conditions are severe enough to identify.
